# CoreDNA Ethics & Compliance Framework

## 🕊️ Core Principles

This document defines ethical boundaries and compliance standards for CoreDNA platform operations.

---

## 1. Voice AI Ethics (Sonic Co-Pilot)

### Data Handling
- **Voice Processing**: Processed locally in user's browser via Web Speech API
- **Audio Storage**: NO audio files stored on CoreDNA servers
- **Transcription**: Only command text transcribed and logged
- **Retention**: Command logs retained 90 days, then auto-deleted
- **User Control**: Users can disable voice anytime in Settings

### Consent Mechanisms
- ✅ Explicit opt-in required (Settings → Enable Sonic Co-Pilot)
- ✅ Tier-gated (Hunter+ only) prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Visual indicator when listening (animated orb + pulse)
- ✅ Easy disable/mute available at all times
- ✅ Terms of Service explicitly covers voice processing

### Third-Party Processing
- Web Speech API processes through browser (Google/browser-native)
- Transcribed commands sent to Gemini API for intent detection
- NO voice audio sent to any third party
- User data never used for model training (see Privacy Policy)

### Accessibility
- ✅ Chat interface fallback for all users (voice optional)
- ✅ Works on all browsers (Chrome/Edge for voice, all for chat)
- ✅ Text input alternative to voice commands
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for command submission
- ✅ ARIA labels on UI components

---

## 2. AI Provider Transparency

### Model Disclosure
Required in user-facing UI:

**Current Integrations:**
```
Intent Detection:     Google Gemini API
Brand Extraction:     Configurable (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude)
Campaign Generation:  n8n workflows (multi-model)
Website Building:     Vercel + Gemini
```

### User Choice
- ✅ Users select preferred AI provider in Settings
- ✅ Default provider clearly marked
- ✅ Switch providers without data loss
- ✅ Pricing varies by provider (disclosed)

### Data Routing
- User data → Supabase (encrypted, user-owned)
- Processing requests → Selected AI provider (via API key)
- NO data shared between providers
- NO data retained by CoreDNA after processing
- Each request includes privacy headers

### Consent Flow
```
User Input
    ↓
Privacy Notice: "Using Gemini for analysis"
    ↓
User confirms (explicit consent required)
    ↓
Send to selected provider (encrypted)
    ↓
Return results (not stored by CoreDNA)
    ↓
User downloads/saves locally if needed
```

## 3. Brand DNA Extraction Ethics

### Website Scraping Standards
- ✅ Respect robots.txt directives
- ✅ Honor nofollow, noindex meta tags
- ✅ Identify as CoreDNA user-agent in requests
- ✅ Implement rate limiting (1 request/sec max)
- ✅ Do NOT scrape authenticated content
- ✅ Do NOT scrape paywalled content
- ✅ Do NOT extract password-protected pages

### Competitive Intelligence Boundaries
**PERMITTED:**
- Publicly available brand information
- Published marketing materials
- Public social media content
- Publicly filed business documents
- Public API documentation

**PROHIBITED:**
- Private employee information
- Confidential business documents
- Proprietary source code
- Trade secrets
- Unpublished strategic plans
- Non-public financial data

### Intellectual Property Safeguards
- ✅ User owns extracted brand data
- ✅ Data not used for model training
- ✅ Data not shared with competitors
- ✅ Data deleted on account closure
- ✅ User grants license to use for own brand only

### User Responsibility
Users warrant they have rights to extract from specified URLs:
- For their own brand: ✅ Always permitted
- For competitors: ✅ Permitted if public information
- For third parties without permission: ❌ Prohibited

CoreDNA provides tools; users responsible for lawful use.

## 4. Data Privacy & Retention

### Voice Data Lifecycle
```
User speaks: "Sonic, extract apple.com"
    ↓
Audio processed locally in browser
    ↓
Transcription extracted: "sonic extract apple.com"
    ↓
Audio discarded (never leaves browser)
    ↓
Command text logged: sonic_logs table
    ↓
Command executed (results shown)
    ↓
Retention: 90 days
    ↓
Auto-delete: After 90 days (scheduled job)
```

### Extraction Data Lifecycle
```
User input: URL to extract
    ↓
Fetch: HTML from target website (public content only)
    ↓
Process: Gemini API analyzes content
    ↓
Result: Brand DNA JSON
    ↓
Storage: User's account (Supabase)
    ↓
Ownership: User (not CoreDNA)
    ↓
Retention: User deletion or account closure
```

### Campaign & Website Data
- User-generated content: User-owned
- AI-generated assets: User-owned (license from OpenAI/Google/etc)
- Template design: Licensed (cannot redistribute)
- Scheduled posts: Stored until published + 30 days

### Third-Party Data Sharing
**NO sharing with:**
- Marketing firms

### Incident Response
**If security incident occurs:**
1. Assess scope (which data affected)
2. Notify affected users within 24 hours
