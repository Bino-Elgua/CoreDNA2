## Compliance Details

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- ✅ **Legal Basis:** Explicit consent (Article 6(1)(a))
- ✅ **Consent:** Granular, timestamped, easy to withdraw
- ✅ **Privacy Notice:** Provided before consent
- ✅ **Data Rights:** Access, deletion, portability implemented
- ✅ **DPA:** Mandatory for all partners
- ✅ **Sub-processors:** Clearbit disclosed and approved
- ✅ **Data Retention:** 12-month auto-delete policy

### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- ✅ **Right to Know:** Opt-out page allows access request
- ✅ **Right to Delete:** 48-hour deletion SLA
- ✅ **Right to Opt-Out:** Clear, easy opt-out mechanism
- ✅ **No Sale:** Visitor data never sold or shared
- ✅ **Disclosure:** Privacy policy updated

### ePrivacy Directive

### CAN-SPAM

- ✅ **Opt-Out Link:** Every email has unsubscribe
- ✅ **No Auto-Send:** Manual approval required

---

## Ethical Safeguards

### No Auto-Send
Partners must manually approve each message. The platform drafts using LLM but never sends without partner action.

### No Dark Patterns
- ✅ Clear language, not confusing
- ✅ No pre-checked consent boxes
- ✅ Company ID is *required*, marketing/sales are *optional*
- ✅ Consent banner blocks content (can't scroll past)

### Self-Scouting Prevention
Platform detects when partner's own IP visits their affiliate page and blocks tracking (logged for audit but not counted).

### Data Controller Model
Partner = **data controller** (responsible for compliance)
CoreDNA = **data processor** (follows partner's instructions)

This places legal responsibility on partner, not CoreDNA, encouraging responsible use.

### Transparent Disclosures
- Clearbit explicitly named
- CoreDNA named as processor
- Partner DPA available to all visitors
- Opt-out link on every page

---

## Financial Model

### Commission Structure
- **20% of subscription revenue** for lifetime of referral
- **Recurring monthly** (if referred customer maintains paid subscription)
- **Automatic calculation** based on referral_converted flag
- **Monthly payouts** via Stripe Connect (coming soon)

### Example
- Partner refers Company X
- Company X signs up for Pro tier ($49/month)
- Partner earns $9.80/month
- If Company X stays subscribed for 36 months = $352.80 total

### Payment
- Commissions calculated and paid monthly
- Automatic via Stripe Connect
